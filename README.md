# POIM (POWER OUTAGE INFO MODULE)Â 
A Power Outage Info module has been invented, designed and developed, which senses electricity supply outages at strategic "nodes" of the Low-tension distribution network. It relays the information back to the Control Room within seconds of occurrence for the Management to take necessary corrective/preventive measures. Not only does the module match the technical requisites, but also, is economic enough to meet the shoe-string budgets of the ailing utilities.
